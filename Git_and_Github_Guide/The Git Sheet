1) git inti projectname-> To create a project.
1 -a)git init will make a folder a git repository.
2) git add filename.extrension -> To add a file.
3) git clone "url" -> To clone a repository to our local repository.
4) git pull -> To update an existing repository.
5) git log -> To see all gthe commits that have happened from the biggining.
6) git diff old_id new_id -> To see the difference between two particular commits about how the code has changed.


	Note: 	The plus sign tell that something is added andf the minus sign tells that something is removed .
7) git log --stat -> to view the changes in stats for for each of the particular files.
8) git checkout id -> To reveret back to a state by removing the commits before the version labelled by the id.
	Note: HEAD is the commit we are currently working on .
		You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
		changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
		state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.
		It says to createa a separate branch to work for use where we can change what ever we want without affecting the others.
8) git -b checkout id -> To make a new branch and make our changes there.
9) git diff --staged -> show the diff between the file in the staging area and the repository.(stging area to the most recent commit)
10) git reset --hard -> discard any change to the working directory and the staging area.
11) git diff -> compares working directory with staging area.
	Note :we can create label for each commit we made this is called branches.
		Combining 2 branches is called merging.
12) git branch -> shows the current branch.
13) git branch name ->creates a branch with the given name.
14) git checkout branch_name -> switch to the specified branch
		Note: A branch created not by us is a remote branch for us.
15) git log --graph --online first_branch second_branch -> compare the two branches by the commit akfter whicg they start differing
16) git merge first_branch second_branchx-> combine two branches.
	Note -> If this error occur.
		Auto-merging file_name
		CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in file_name
		Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
		This error means that both the branches have changed the same part of the file. So git can not choose among them on who to choose.
		Then do this:
		1)Restore your files to their state before you started the merge by running git merge --abort.
		2) Go to the branch u recently worked in and commit all the changes.
		3) Try commiting again.
17) git show -> To know the difference between a commit and its parent without knowing who commited it.
18) git branch -d coins -> delete the branch . This will not delete the commits in the branch. 

		Note: There is a scenario.
			JAke -> A,B,C
			Eman -> A,B',C
			these are two branches . When we perform git merge then git can not judge which amon B,B' or both to keep.

19) git remote ->To see all the current remotes.
20) git remote add name_for_repository(recommended to be origin) URL_of _the_repos

	Note : When we clone a repository git automatically creates a remote name origin for our repository. 


	Note: To fork a repository we need to go to the repository and click fork button on the up-right.
